The bank with new concept. We are the bank that gives the change for free of cost. Say, if you give me a 100 Rs. Note, then based on the available denominations, I should give you a change with denominations < 100 Rs. Notes. It’s an automated system.

As a: Banker, in the morning, I should feed the machine with the different denominations & number of counts. As an example: I may enter 100 Rs. – 10 notes, 50 Rs. - 20 notes, 10 Rs. – 30 notes, 5 Rs. – 50 notes, 1 Rs. – 100 notes. I may choose to not feed the machine with 20 Rs. As a: Customer, I can enter only 1 note @ a time.

Maximum possible denomination value is 1000 Rs.

ATs:

When I insert a note, it should give me the change starting from next highest note to lowest note.

If exact change isn’t possible, it should return my note indicating the same.

If the note I inserted is the lowest then it should indicate the same & inform that we don't have denomination of lower value

If banker hasn’t deposited any denominations or say the machine has no denominations then it should not allow user to insert any note, indicating that the machine is outoforder or empty.
